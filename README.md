# Anti-Cheat System

A modular anti-cheat framework designed to detect and prevent common cheating techniques in FPS-style games. Inspired by Valorant’s Vanguard system, this project is organized into multiple components, each focusing on a specific detection or prevention method.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **`src/`**  
  Contains the source code scripts for each anti-cheat module. Each script implements a distinct detection or defense mechanism.

- **`docs/`**  
  Detailed documentation for every component, explaining its purpose, implementation details, and usage instructions. Click any component below to jump to its section.

- **`logs/`**  
  Stores runtime log files generated by the anti-cheat modules. Logs capture alerts, detections, and errors for review and analysis.

- **`keys/`**  
  Holds cryptographic key files, including private and public RSA keys, used for digital signing and verification processes within certain modules.

- **`baseline/`**  
  Contains encrypted baseline files and their corresponding digital signatures, used as trusted references for integrity verification.

## 📚 Component Documentation

### [File Integrity Checker](docs/file_integrity.md)  
Detects unauthorized modifications to critical game files by comparing cryptographic hashes against a digitally signed baseline.

### [Memory Monitor](docs/memory_monitor.md)
Monitors system memory to detect suspicious patterns indicating code injection or memory tampering.

### [Kernel Monitor](docs/kernel_monitor.md) (Work In Progress) 
Tracks kernel-level driver activity to identify unauthorized or malicious kernel modules.

### [Process Watcher](docs/process_watcher.md) (Work In Progress) 
Watches running processes and flags blacklisted or anomalous behavior indicative of cheat tools.

### [Input Logger Detector](docs/input_logger_detector.md) (Work In Progress)  
Detects unusual input patterns or injected inputs that may result from macros or keyloggers.

### [Network Sniffer Blocker](docs/network_sniffer_blocker.md) (Work In Progress)  
Identifies network sniffing or man-in-the-middle tools that attempt to intercept game traffic.

### [Behavior Analysis](docs/behavior_analysis.md) (Work In Progress)  
Analyzes player behavior data to detect aimbots, wallhacks, or other automated cheating strategies.
